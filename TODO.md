# TODO

- Make CLI help output style consistent across commands and subcommands.
- Refactor `noraa run-smoke fetch-data --help` UX to look command-oriented like top-level `noraa --help`.
- Reduce dense option-heavy screens where possible; prefer clearer subcommand flows and concise descriptions.
- Ensure help text presents "what to run next" in a consistent format across CLI sections.
